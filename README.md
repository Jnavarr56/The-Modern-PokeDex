# Pokemon Database (Pokedex)


This is a dynamic dashboard that uses the official pokemon API to present general information and statistics on searched pokemon. Part of a bootcamp assignment, I decided to take it to another level and create an app that would present a comprehensive profile of each pokemon, even speaking various facts about the pokemon.

  - jQuery
  - CSS3
  - HTML5
  - Artyom.js (speech synthesis package)

## Deployed Using Github Pages

  - jnavarr56.github.io

### How to Use

Type in the desired pokemon in the search bar OR click "Pokemon Search" for a random pokemon.


### Landing Page

The landing page will present an interesting loading animation of a spinning Pokeball along with Japanese text and a computer voice introducing the user.

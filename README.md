# Pokemon Database (Pokedex)


This is a dynamic dashboard that uses the official pokemon API to present general information and statistics on searched pokemon. Part of a bootcamp assignment, I decided to take it to another level and create an app that would present a comprehensive profile of each pokemon, even speaking various facts about the pokemon.

  - jQuery
  - CSS3
  - HTML5
  - Artyom.js (speech synthesis package)

## Deployed Using Github Pages

  - jnavarr56.github.io

### How to Use

1) Type in the desired pokemon in the search bar OR click POKEMON SEARCH for a random pokemon.
2) Click INDEX THIS POKEMON to add viewed Pokemon to the box on the left.
3) Click on the Pokemon's names that are in the box to hear a pronounciation and switch to that Pokemon's profile.
4) Click the FACT READING BUTTON when a Pokemon is loaded to hear different facts about them.
5) Remove Pokemon from the box by clicking the red X next to their name.
6) Clicking EXPORT TO CSV will produce a spreadsheet of all indexed Pokemon if there are any.



### Landing Page

The landing page will present an interesting loading animation of a spinning Pokeball along with Japanese text and a computer voice introducing the user.
